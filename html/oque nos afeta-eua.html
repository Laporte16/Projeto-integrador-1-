                <h1>What affects us</h1>
                Air pollution has gradually intensified since the mid-20th century with the rise of the ambient atmosphere and the emergence of automotive industries, which release pollution into the atmosphere. <br> Among the main air pollutants, we
                can mention smoke, inhalable particles, sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide.<br>These substances can cause serious harm to human health. Carbon monoxide, for example, decreases the blood's ability to transport air
                around the body. It already has the oxidizing role capable of resisting the eyes and the increase of cytotoxics, for example. <br>Sulfur dioxide is related to upper airway irritations, like nitrogen dioxide, the latter can also cause severe
                damage to the lungs. that can cause people to develop breathing problems, such as breathing difficulties; bronchial irritations such as bronchitis; fall of the immune system; neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
