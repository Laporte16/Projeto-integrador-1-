                <h2>Urban pollution</h2>
                <p> Air pollution in urban regions has increased due to increasing industrial activity and the increase
                    in the number of motorized land, air and sea vehicles already manufactured.
                    The urban air quality has caused serious problems to the living conditions of the human being as a
                    whole, in the plants and animals that live in and around cities. <br>

                    We can introduce three of the main types of urban pollution to be tackled or reduced: air pollution,
                    water pollution and soil pollution and degradation. Minimizing the effects of these human actions in
                    the urban space is of fundamental importance to guarantee what is called urban sustainability, that
                    is, the promotion of urban development that does not compromise the environment for future
                    generations. <br>

                    In times of rain, all the garbage accumulated on the streets and sidewalks is drained towards the
                    course of a river, which becomes unusable, and the soil, in the space of cities, also ends up being
                    the target of high pollution, which occurs mainly through disposal in places inappropriate. <br>

                    <p>In sanitary landfills and dumps, the accumulation of urban waste generates a polluting liquid
                        called leachate, a percolated or leached liquid, which is capable of polluting the air, soil and
                        water. <br>

                        And it makes the soils unproductive, and in addition, when the liquid reaches the water table,
                        it forms pollution, it also compromises the availability of water. <br>
                        Air pollution is one of the main aggravating factors for the reduction of the quality of life on
                        the planet, and this includes even the urban centers of developed countries, and pollution in
                        urban centers manifests itself, mainly, with the degradation of the air, of the water and soil
                        resources. <br>

                        In Brazil, metropolises and large capitals also experience the same problems as in the large
                        city of São Paulo, the largest metropolis in the country, according to estimates carried out by
                        environmental NGOs, there are 20% more chances of the population to suffer from lung cancer
                        compared to cities less polluting. </p>
