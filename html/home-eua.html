            Está-no-ar is an informative website with the aim of teaching what air pollution is and how it happens,
            showing how much it can be harmful to humanity and the world, and how air pollution can be contributing to
            that other pollutions occur. The site will have six pages in total (home-causes-urban pollution-what affects
            us-pollution dominoes-contact), the home page will present the site and the topic it addresses, while the
            causes page will address the causes of air pollution problems. Urban pollution will deal with how urban
            pollution occurs and how it contributes to the problem in general, the what affects us page will address the
            damage caused to humanity by air pollution, such as respiratory diseases, etc. pollution triggers other
            forms of pollution, such as acid rain, and the contact page will provide ways to contact site contributors.
            the site will be produced in html and css, and the framework produced in canva and figma, management and
            organization through trello.

                    <br>
                    <p>Air or atmospheric pollution can be defined as the result of the release of large amounts of
                        solid or liquid particles into the atmosphere with the potential to cause environmental impacts
                        or harm human health. Among these substances we can mention industrial dust, aerosols, black
                        smoke, solvents, acids and hydrocarbons.

                        When we burn something like wood, we are keeping the same amount of carbon inside the system,
                        but sending it into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.

                        However, when we burn a fossil fuel such as mineral coal or oil, we are bringing into the same
                        system enormous amounts of substances that, long ago, were fossilized. This means that the
                        amount of carbon injected into the medium is more than enough to cause its imbalance.
